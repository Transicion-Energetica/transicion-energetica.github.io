This policy paper provides an integral perspective on the challenges and opportunities of addressing climate change that the guarantee of a just energy transition will offer, emphasising on the necessary policies and instruments for enhancing synergies between climate and the energy governmental agendas, to close the gap between Mexicoâ€™s national pledges and climate action. Nonetheless, the public debates in Mexico have not addressed energy transition issues under a social, environmental and political perspective. This paper therefore includes policy recommendations to both the climate change problem and those within the governance structure of the electricity sector, placing the social and environmental inequalities into the center of policy making with the aim to guarantee an adequate distribution of costs and benefits of the deployment of renewable energy technologies and projects in Mexico and accelerate climate action
